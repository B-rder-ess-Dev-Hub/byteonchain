|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Arbitrum  | 42161   | `0xbD75f629A22Dc1ceD33dDA0b68c546A1c035c458`          | [Arbitrum EAS Scan](https://arbitrum.easscan.org) |
| Base      | 8453    | `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000021`          | [Base EAS Scan](https://base.easscan.org)         |
| Celo      | 42220   | `0x72E1d8ccf5299fb36fEfD8CC4394B8ef7e98Af92`          | [Celo EAS Scan](https://celo.easscan.org)         |
| Optimism  | 10      | `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000021`          | [Optimism EAS Scan](https://optimism.easscan.org) |


## Attestation Schemas
Byteonchain uses the following attestation schemas:

| Schema Type  | Schema UID |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Onboarding  | `0xadc627b3baae8680c1e7d1f080ea5e50738e7efcc93e95a35269e6841116fffe` |
| Course      | `0xe9a059a2f6cf3a119b0f8c1d5dc022711a447c7fbb94baf6ce670ca2e6faeaeb` (Arbitrum, Base, Celo) |
| Course      | `0x146d8e99fb116e3bf7d24b5596e50893d3a5fe12d072a3469b1198c79df9103d` (Optimism) |


### Deployer Address
The smart contracts were deployed using the following deployer address:

```

## Features
- **Onboarding Attestation:** Users can attest their participation in onboarding events and courses.
- **Quiz Verification:** Attest quiz details and validate user achievements.
- **Multi-Chain Support:** Operates across Celo, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base networks.
- **Tamper-Proof Records:** Immutable attestations stored on the blockchain.
- **Gas-Efficient Transactions:** Optimized for minimal transaction costs.

## How It Works
1. Users participate in an onboarding event or course.
2. Quiz details are recorded on-chain using EAS attestations.
3. Attestations serve as proof of completion and can be verified publicly.
